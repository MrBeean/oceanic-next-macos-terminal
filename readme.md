# Oceanic Next theme for macOS Terminal

Based on the awesome [Oceanic Next](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme) by [Dmitri Voronianski](https://github.com/voronianski)

### Installation
Download the repo   
Open Terminal go to **Preferences** and choose the **Profiles** tab   
Click the cog at the bottom of the profiles list and import **oceanic-next.terminal**  from the download file   
Select **oceanic-next** from the list of profiles and hit **Default** to make it...you guessed it...the default profile
Restart Terminal

*You can then adjust to your preferred font, in the screenshot I am using SF Mono Light @ 14pt with line spacing bumped to 1.1*
